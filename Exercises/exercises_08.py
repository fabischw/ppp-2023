# Prepare an analysis of the titanic dataset (data/titanic.csv).
# You are interested in determining factors that lead to death or survival of passengers.
# However, before actually training an ML model to predict death or survival, you should make
# yourself familiar with the data.
#
# Look into which features are available, what types of features these are, whether
# values are missing and how to deal with them, etc.
# You can then continue to create some visualizations of things you think might be interesting or relevant
# in predicting survival, or just generally useful to know about the dataset.
# The output should not just be prints of numbers or figures, but also some explanatory text of
# what you have been analysing, and which conclusions you can draw from the different steps of your analysis.
#
# You can do all of this in a Jupyter Notebook, embedding analysis, code and explanations in a single document.
# Alternatively you can create a separate script for the analysis, and then list results, figures and explanations
# either in the PR directly, or in some form of pdf/word/markdown/... document.
#
# For this exercise I very much encourage you to work together to come up with ideas of which
# calculations/plots/... might be interesting to analyse. You will find very many such analyses online
# for the titanic data, but I would recommend trying to think of your own ideas first, and only later
# look for more inspiration online.
