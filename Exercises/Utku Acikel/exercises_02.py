# Write a function that takes as input a list of integers and returns a single integer number.
# the numbers passed as argument form the working memory of a simulated computer.
# this computer will start by looking at the first value in the list passed to the function.
# this value will contain an `opcode`. Valid opcodes are 1, 2 or 99.
# Encountering any other value when you expect an opcode indicates an error in your coding.
# Meaning of opcodes:
#  1 indicates addition. If you encounter the opcode 1 you should read values from two positions 
#    of your working memory, add them, and store the result in a third position of your working memory.
#    The three numbers immediately after your opcode indicate the memory locations to read (first two values)
#    and write (third value) respectively. 
#    After executing the addition you should move to the next opcode by stepping forward 4 positions.
#  2 indicates multiplication. Otherwise the same rules apply as for opcode 1.
# 99 indicates halt. the program should stop after encountering the opcode 99.
# After the program stops, the function should return the value in the first location (address 0) 
# of your working memory.

# As an example, if the list of integers passed to your function is 
# [1, 0, 0, 0, 99] the 1 in the first position indicates you should read the values
# at position given by the second and third entries. Both of these indicate position 0, so you should read the value
# at position 0 twice. That value is 1. Adding 1 and 1 gives you two. You then look at the value in the fourth
# position, which is again 0, so you write the result to position 0. You then step forward by 4 steps, arriving at 99
# and ending the program. The final memory looks like [2, 0, 0, 0, 99]. Your function should return 2.

# Here's another testcase:
# [1, 1, 1, 4, 99, 5, 6, 0, 99] should become [30, 1, 1, 4, 2, 5, 6, 0, 99]
# Your function should return 30.


# print out which value is returned by your function for the following list:

def sim_computer(storage):
    i = 0
    while storage[i] != 99:
        if storage [i] == 1:
            storage[storage[i+3]] = storage[storage[i+1]] + storage[storage[i+2]]
        elif storage[i] == 2:
            storage[storage[i+3]] = storage[storage[i+1]] * storage[storage[i+2]]
        else:
            print("ERROR")
        i += 4
    return storage[0]
