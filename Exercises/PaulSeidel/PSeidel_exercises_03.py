# PART 3:
# write a function that accepts two numbers, a lower bound and an upper bound.
# the function should then return the count of all numbers that meet certain criteria:
# - they are within the (left-inclusive and right-exclusive) bounds passed to the function
# - there is at least one group of exactly two adjacent digits within the number which are the same (like 33 in 123345)
# - digits only increase going from left to right
#
# Examples:
# - 123345 is a valid number
# - 123341 is not a valid number, as the digits do not increase from left to right
# - 123334 is not a valid number as there is no group of exactly two repeated digits
# - 111334 is a valid number. while there are three 1s, there is also a group of exactly two 3s.
# - 112233 is a valid number. At least one group of two is fulfilled, there is no maximum to the number of such groups.
#
# run your function with the lower bound `134564` and the upper bound `585159`. Note the resulting count
# in your pull request, please.
