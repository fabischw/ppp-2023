# This is the continuation of last weeks exercise.
# After having analysed the Titanic Dataset, you should now prepare a machine
# learning model to predict whether passengers will survive.
#
# It is entirely up to you which algorithm and feature engineering to use.
# I do recommend using some of the algorithms available in sklearn, but if you would 
# like to use another library that's also ok. It's a good idea to try and evaluate different algorithms,
# and different pre-processing/cleaning/feature-generation options if you have the time.
#
# I have split the training data into a train- and a test-set already. These can be found as separate files 
# in the `data`-directory. You should only use the training set throughout your entire development -- feel free 
# to use cross-validation or split the training set into a train- and a validation set again.
# Once you have developed a final model, you should evaluate this model on the test set I've provided,
# and report the MCC score for the test set in the title of your PR. You should **not** evaluate the test
# set more than once for this initial submission!
#
# If you decide to change your code after code-review, you can report new values in the comments, but
# leave the initial MCC in the title unchanged.
