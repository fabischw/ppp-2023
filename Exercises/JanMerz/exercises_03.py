# PART 1:
# Write a class for a French deck of cards (2-Ace of diamonds, hearts, spades, clubs).
# The deck of cards should behave like a sequence.
# When initialized the cards should all be in a well-defined order (2-Ace of each suite, suites in the order above
# I should be able to index into the deck to retrieve one card.
# I should be able to iterate over all cards in the deck.
# Printing a cards string representation should give me a nice, 
# readable description of that card.

# PART 2:
# Create a second class that represents a deck of cards usable for Skat -- it should only contain cards from 7 upwards.
# It should offer all the same functionality of the first class.

class SkatDeck(FrenchDeck):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__(5)


# Write some code to test the functionality of both kinds of decks. (You can use `assert` to make sure your classes behave the way you expect them to.)
french_deck = FrenchDeck()

print("\n", french_deck[10], "\n")

skat_deck = SkatDeck()

for card in skat_deck.cards:
    print(card)

print("\n", skat_deck[10], "\n")


# PART 3:
# write a function that accepts two numbers, a lower bound and an upper bound.
# the function should then return the count of all numbers that meet certain criteria:
# - they are within the (left-inclusive and right-exclusive) bounds passed to the function
# - there is at least one group of exactly two adjacent digits within the number which are the same (like 33 in 123345)
# - digits only increase going from left to right
#
# Examples:
# - 123345 is a valid number
# - 123341 is not a valid number, as the digits do not increase from left to right
# - 123334 is not a valid number as there is no group of exactly two repeated digits
# - 111334 is a valid number. while there are three 1s, there is also a group of exactly two 3s.
# - 112233 is a valid number. At least one group of two is fulfilled, there is no maximum to the number of such groups.
#
# run your function with the lower bound `134564` and the upper bound `585159`. Note the resulting count
# in your pull request, please.
