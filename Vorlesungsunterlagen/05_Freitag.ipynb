    "# Interlude: First notes on coding style\n",
    "Source: [Python documentation on python.org](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#id2)\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you are about to write longer, more complex pieces of Python, it is a good time to talk about coding style. Most languages can be written (or more concise, formatted) in different styles; some are more readable than others. Making it easy for others to read your code is always a good idea, and adopting a nice coding style helps tremendously for that.\n",
    "\n",
    "For Python, [PEP 8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) has emerged as the style guide that most projects adhere to; it promotes a very readable and eye-pleasing coding style. Every Python developer should read it at some point; here are the most important points extracted for you:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use 4-space indentation, and no tabs.\n",
    "  - 4 spaces are a good compromise between small indentation (allows greater nesting depth) and large indentation (easier to read). Tabs introduce confusion, and are best left out.\n",
    "- Wrap lines so that they don’t exceed 79 characters. \\[NOTE: debatable, you could also agree on e.g. 120 characters given todays screens\\]\n",
    "  - This helps users with small displays and makes it possible to have several code files side-by-side on larger displays.\n",
    "- Use blank lines to separate functions and classes, and larger blocks of code inside functions.\n",
    "  - \\[NOTE: Typically: 2 lines between pure functions, one line between methods in a class\\]\n",
    "- When possible, put comments on a line of their own.\n",
    "- Use docstrings.\n",
    "- Use spaces around operators and after commas, but not directly inside bracketing constructs: `a = f(1, 2) + g(3, 4)`.\n",
    "- Name your classes and functions consistently; the convention is to use **UpperCamelCase for classes** and **lowercase_with_underscores for functions and methods**. Always use self as the name for the first method argument (see A First Look at Classes for more on classes and methods).\n",
    "- Use UTF-8 encoding for any source files.\n",
    "- Still though, don’t use non-ASCII characters in identifiers if there is only the slightest chance people speaking a different language will read or maintain the code."

In Python, polymorphism often involves method overriding, where a subclass provides its own implementation of a method inherited from a superclass.\n",

    "#### Overview: Special methods for classes:\n",
    "- **instance creation and destruction**\n",
    "  - `__init__`: instance constructor, shown above\n",
    "  - `__del__`: instance destructor\n",
    "  - `__new__`: called before new instance is created, should return the instance; \n",
    "- **str/bytes representation**\n",
    "  - `__repr__`: compute 'official' string representation; should look like a valid Python expression that could be used to recreate an object with the same values.\n",
    "  - `__str__`: 'informal' or nicely printable string representation of an object. The return value must be a string object.\n",
    "  - `__bytes__`: compute a byte-string representation of an object. This should return a bytes object.\n",
    "  - `__format__`: Called by the format() built-in, and by extension, evaluation of f-strings to produce a 'formatted' string representation of an object\n",
    "- **comparison operators**\n",
    "  - `__lt__` (<), `__le__` (<=), `__eq__` (==), `__ge__` (>=), `__gt__` (>), `__ne__` (!=): 'rich comparison' operators; should return `True` or `False`;\n",
    "- **hash calculation**\n",
    "  - implemented by defining the `__hash__`-method, should return an integer\n",
    "  - equal hashes /must/ imply objects compare equal (but not vice versa)\n",
    "  - if `__eq__` is not defined you also should not define `__hash__`\n",
    "  - recommendation: stick all relevant attributes into a tuple and calculate the hash of the tuple\n",
    "  - only for 'immutable' objects; if the values can change lookups in dicts/sets can break\n",
    "- **type conversions**\n",
    "  - `__bool__`: conversion to bool, should return `True` or `False`; default behaviour: the object is considered truthy if len(object) != 0; If neither is defined all instances are considered truthy.\n",
    "  - `__int__`, `__float__`, `__complex__`: conversion to the appropriate types if defined\n",
    "  - `__index__`: e.g. when the object should be used for slicing\n",
    "- **unary math**:\n",
    "  - `__neg__` (-), `__pos__` (+), `__abs__` (abs), \n",
    "- **arithmetic**:\n",
    "  - `__add__` (+), `__sub__` (-), `__mul__` (*), `__truediv__` (/), `__floordiv__` (//), `__mod__` (%), `__divmod__` (divmod), `__pow__` (**): 'normal' arithmetic\n",
    "  - `__radd__` (+), `__rsub__` (-), `__rmul__` (*), `__rtruediv__` (/), `__rfloordiv__` (//), `__rmod__` (%), `__rdivmod__` (divmod), `__rpow__` (**): 'right/reversed' arithmetic, if normal is `NotImplemented`\n",
    "  - `__iadd__` (+), `__isub__` (-), `__imul__` (*), `__itruediv__` (/), `__ifloordiv__` (//), `__imod__` (%), `__ipow__` (**): in-place modification\n",
    "  - `__round__` (round), `__trunc__` (math.trunc), `__floor__` (math.floor), `__ceil__` (math.ceil): precision changes\n",
    "- **bitwise operators**:\n",
    "  -  `__invert__` (~): unary operators\n",
    "  -  `__lshift__` (<<), `__rshift__` (>>), `__and__` (&), `__or__` (|), `__xor__` (^): normal binary operators\n",
    "  -  `__rlshift__` (<<), `__rrshift__` (>>), `__rand__` (&), `__ror__` (|), `__rxor__` (^): 'right/reversed' binary operators, if normal is `NotImplemented`\n",
    "  -  `__ilshift__` (<<), `__irshift__` (>>), `__iand__` (&), `__ior__` (|), `__ixor__` (^): in-place binary operators"

    "- **Containers**:\n",
    "  - `__len__`: return the number of elements in the container, used by builting `len`\n",
    "  - `__getitem__`: used to implement `[]` with index/slice (sequence-like) or key (mapping-like)\n",
    "  - `__setitem__`: element modification, otherwise as above\n",
    "  - `__delitem__`: used to implement `del object[key]`, otherwise as above\n",
    "  - `__iter__`, `__reversed__`: used to iterate over the elements in the container (eg by `for element in object`). Implement `reversed` only if your implementation is more efficient that backwards iteration.\n",
    "  - `__contains__`: for tests like `element in container` if those can be implemented more efficiently than by iteration over all elements\n",

    "- **emulating callables**:\n",
    "  - `__call__`: makes instance objects callable as functions\n",

    "- **context management**:\n",
    "  - `__enter__`, `__exit__`: used to implement `with` blocks (discussed last week)\n",
    "- **attribute access**:\n",
    "  - `__getattribute__`: Called unconditionally to implement attribute accesses for instances of the class.\n",
    "  - `__getattr__`:  Called when the default attribute access fails with an AttributeError\n",
    "  - `__setattr__`: Called when an attribute assignment is attempted. Replaces the default behaviour (storing the value in the class dict)\n",
    "  - `__delattr__`: Like `__setattr__` except for deletion (`del object.attribute`)\n",
    "  - `__dir__`: Called when dir() is called on the object. A sequence must be returned. dir() converts the returned sequence to a list and sorts it."
